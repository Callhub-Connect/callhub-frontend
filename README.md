# CallHub: Connect

Where Support Meets Innovation.

CallHub is an interactive call center application, designed to revolutionize how organizations engage with customers during support interactions.

When a client calls a support center, CallHub generates a unique code, granting the support agent and the client access to a real-time, dual-interfaced, and *encrypted* workspace featuring:
  - **Document Upload:** Easily upload and share documents during the call.
  - **E-Signature:** Seamlessly sign agreements or forms during the conversation.
  - **Text Messaging:** Enable text-based communication alongside voice.
